OOP's == Object Oriented Programing System 
4 pillers of OOP's 
    1. Abstraction
    2. Encapsulation
    3. Inheritance
    4. Polymorphisum


1.Abstraction  --> Only essential details are displayed to user
[HIDING THE UNNESSESORY DATA FROM USER]


real time example: Car Break,

    {We know the function of breack to stop te car or any vehical 
        but we don't know the internal mechanisum  is knows as Abstraction}


2.Encapsulation  --> binding the data into a Single unit. 



3.Inheritance  --> One Class can allow to inherit the features of another class 

-by using the extend keyword
-inheritance is also known as IS-A relationship

    1.Superclass  -whose features are inherited
    2.Subclass    -that class inherits the other class
    3.Reusability  - reuse the code. 

4.Polymorphisum  -->
            1.Method Overloading
            2.Method Overriding

1.Method Overloading-->Compile-time Polymorphisum
        more than one method share the same name with diff.parameter in a class .the return type of these method can or cannot be same.


2. Method Overrriding -->Runtime Polymorphisum
        Methods in child class has the same name , return type and parameter as in parent class.
